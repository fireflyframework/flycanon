## Why this service exists

Every operations team builds the same workflow underneath process
docs, compliance runbooks, vendor agreements, internal policies, and
post-incident retrospectives:

> _"Take this document, file it under the right thing, keep the
> version chain honest, and let me ask it questions later — with
> citations I can audit."_

Doing that with a wiki is a losing game: layouts change, formats
mutate (DOCX, PDF, scanned PDF, HEIC, ZIP bundles, `.eml`
threads…), and the team ends up hand-copying snippets into another
tool every time a single thing moves.

**flycanon** collapses the whole workflow into a single HTTP
service. You ship any file format, declare the metadata you care
about, and the service hands back a structured `SourceRecord` whose
content is parsed, normalised, chunked, embedded, and indexed —
ready for hybrid retrieval and grounded RAG answers. Knowledge is
never edited in place: every revision appends a new version row, the
previous one transitions to `superseded`, and the provenance graph
travels with it.

It is built to drop into a production back-office stack: idempotent
APIs, event-driven downstream notifications via a durable Postgres
outbox, observability out of the box, and clean failure isolation
per pipeline stage.

---

## What you get back

You give the service one HTTP request. The response is a single JSON
object that carries, for every interaction:

| Layer                       | What it tells you                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sources**                 | `SourceRecord` per ingested artefact (id, kind, status, content sha256, chunk count, ancestry chain when the artefact came out of a bundle). Bulk + async ingest variants return per-item results / a job id; `PUT /api/v1/sources/{id}` re-ingests in place and preserves the row id. |
| **Knowledge items**         | Canonical pointer (status, current version, domain, jurisdiction). Updates append a new version; the previous one flips to `superseded`. `GET /api/v1/knowledge/{id}/diff` returns a unified diff + field changes + citation set deltas between any two versions. |
| **Knowledge versions**      | Append-only revisions of a knowledge item. Citations to source chunks travel with the edge.                                                    |
| **Knowledge graph**         | Typed edges between items (`related` / `depends_on` / `conflicts_with` / `replaces`) over `/api/v1/knowledge/{id}/relations`, plus a whole-canon view at `/api/v1/knowledge:graph` (JSON or `Accept: text/vnd.mermaid`). Conflict detection materialises `conflicts_with` edges automatically. |
| **Candidates**              | Pre-canonical LLM proposals tied to a source. Accept / reject lifecycle materialises them into the knowledge chain.                            |
| **Hybrid retrieval**        | `SearchResponse` with BM25 (Postgres `tsvector` + GIN) + dense vectors (`pgvector`) fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), optional cross-encoder rerank (Cohere / Voyage), and optional LLM query expansion. Each hit carries `chunk_id`, `source_id`, `source_filename`, `source_title`, `source_kind`, `source_uri`, `section_path`, `page`, the matching `content`, and the fused `score` — UIs can render citation labels without a second `GET /api/v1/sources/{id}`. |
| **Grounded RAG answers**    | `AnswerResponse` with the answer + citation list (same enriched `Hit` shape — filename / title / kind / section / page populated), `model`, `elapsed_ms`, `no_answer`. `POST /api/v1/query/stream` emits the same payload as Server-Sent Events. A grounded "I don't know" is `no_answer: true` — flycanon never hallucinates. |
| **Conversations**           | Multi-turn threads at `/api/v1/conversations/...` with rolling summary + last-N-turn context windowing. Each turn returns the same enriched citation set as `/query`; `:suggest` proposes 3-5 grounded follow-up questions. |
| **Provenance**              | Resolved citation graph for one knowledge version plus the source summaries it touches plus the version chain of its item.                     |
| **Async ingest jobs**       | `IngestJob` row + SSE event stream for any large or bulk ingest. Status / stage / progress / source id / RFC 7807 error envelope all surface through `GET /api/v1/ingest-jobs/{id}` and `GET /api/v1/ingest-jobs/{id}/stream` (resume with `?after_id=` or `Last-Event-ID`). |
| **Knowledge quality**       | `GET /api/v1/knowledge:stale` returns per-item staleness scores (cosine vs fresh sources, 6h cached); `POST /api/v1/knowledge:detect-conflicts` runs an LLM-judged pairwise conflict scan, queues confirmed conflicts as candidates, and auto-creates the matching `conflicts_with` edges. |
| **PII guardrail**           | Configurable regex scanner with four policies (`disabled` / `warn` / `redact` / `reject`). Runs on every intake path (initial submit, bulk, async, replace). `reject` returns RFC 7807 + `findings[]` so callers can surface a precise diagnostic. |
| **Billing + cost stream**   | `/api/v1/billing` aggregates spend; `/events` drills into per-call breadcrumbs (correlation id, subject, latency); `/summary` returns 24h / 7d / 30d snapshots; `/top` and `/by-subject` answer "who" and "where did it go"; `/latency` returns p50 / p95 / p99 from the same cost-event stream. |
| **Corpus inventory**        | `GET /api/v1/stats` -- one-shot snapshot covering sources (by kind + status + bytes), knowledge items (by status + domain), versions, candidates, chunks (embedded coverage), ingest jobs (by status + avg attempts), and the cost headline (24h / 30d). |
| **Append-only audit log**   | Every mutation (`/api/v1/audit`) with correlation id, actor, payload, and W3C trace context.                                                   |
| **EDA topics**              | Three durable topics published via the Postgres outbox: `flycanon.ingest`, `flycanon.knowledge`, `flycanon.audit`.                              |
| **RFC 7807 error envelope** | Every non-2xx response is a `ProblemDetail` (singular) payload from `flycanon.web.conventions` with a stable `code` field for branching. `type` URI base: `https://firefly.dev/problems/...`. |
| **OpenAPI 3.1**             | Multi-paragraph DTO descriptions mixing business and technical context, served live at `/openapi.json` (Swagger UI at `/docs`, ReDoc at `/redoc`). |

## Universal ingestion

Submit any file format. flycanon detects the media type from the
magic bytes (stdlib `mimetypes` + a curated header table + ZIP
central-directory inspection to disambiguate Office formats from
generic archives) and routes the payload through a fixed routing
matrix before the parse / chunk / embed / index pipeline runs:

| Class            | Examples                                          | Strategy                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plain text       | `text/plain`, `text/markdown`, `text/csv`, JSON, XML | Pass-through.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **PDF — Full Digital Text** | Born-digital PDFs (Word / LibreOffice / LaTeX exports, browser "Save as PDF", reporting pipelines) | **Phase 1 (PyMuPDF text-layer):** `pymupdf.get_text()` per page returns the encoded text stream in reading order. No rendering, microseconds per page. |
| **PDF — Image (scanned)** | Scanned contracts, fax output, photographed pages, mobile-camera captures — pages are raster images of the original | **Phase 2 (OCR fallback):** pages under `_MIN_CHARS_PER_PAGE` rasterised by PyMuPDF at `_OCR_DPI` (200) and OCR'd via Tesseract (`pytesseract.image_to_string`) — engine selectable via `FLYCANON_PDF_OCR_ENGINE` (`tesseract` default; `docling` for layout-aware OCR with the `docling` extra). Languages default to `eng+spa`, override via `FLYCANON_OCR_LANG`. |
| **PDF — Hybrid** | Mixed: typed body + scanned signature page, or any blend of digital and image pages | Phase 1 runs on every page; Phase 2 only fires for pages flagged as image-only. The two phases compose page-by-page. |
| PDF — guard rail | Encrypted or corrupt PDFs                       | Rejected up-front by `PdfGuard` (lightweight `pypdf` pre-flight) with `error_code=encrypted_pdf` / `corrupt_source`.                                              |
| Office           | DOCX / XLSX / PPTX / ODT / ODS / ODP / RTF        | `office_converter=none` (default) uses native per-format loaders (python-docx / openpyxl / python-pptx / odfpy / striprtf); `gotenberg` (HTTP sidecar) or `libreoffice` (in-container `soffice`) render to PDF first.            |
| Raster images    | PNG / JPG / WEBP                                  | Pass-through to OCR (Tesseract, multi-language).                                                                                                                  |
| Converted images | HEIC / AVIF / TIFF / SVG / BMP                    | Pillow + pillow-heif + cairosvg → PNG, then OCR.                                                                                                                  |
| Archives         | ZIP / 7Z / TAR / TAR.GZ / TAR.BZ2 / EPUB          | Expanded recursively (capped at `binary_max_recursion_depth` and `binary_max_expanded_files`). Each child re-enters the normaliser.                               |
| Emails           | EML / MSG                                         | Body + each attachment exposed as a separate artefact carrying `parent_artifact` ancestry.                                                                        |
| Web              | HTML / XHTML                                      | BeautifulSoup-backed `HtmlLoader`.                                                                                                                                |
| Transcripts      | WebVTT / SRT                                      | Cue-aware loader.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Unknown          | _everything else_                                 | `UnsupportedBinaryError` → `IngestionFailed` event with stable `code`.                                                                                            |

Multi-artefact intakes (archives, multi-attachment emails) are merged
into a single Markdown document with `## Artifact: <filename>`
section markers, so chunks remain attributable via
`metadata.parent_artifact`.

## Postgres-native retrieval

The BM25 corpus is co-located with the dense projection so hybrid
retrieval is a single-host, Postgres-native operation:

- **BM25** rides on a `tsvector` + GIN index on `canon_chunks.tsv`
  (a Postgres GENERATED column derived from `content`). No extra
  service, no SQLite file. Text-search config is `simple` by default
  (multilingual); switch to `english` / `spanish` / … via
  `FLYCANON_BM25_TEXT_SEARCH_CONFIG`.
- **Dense vectors** live in a pluggable backend. `pgvector` (default) keeps
  them in the same operational Postgres — an HNSW index on `vector_cosine_ops`,
  tuneable `m` / `ef_construction`. `qdrant` and `chroma` use the adapters that
  ship in `fireflyframework-agentic`.

`FLYCANON_VECTOR_STORE` selects the **dense** backend (BM25 always stays on
Postgres):

| Backend       | Use case                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`pgvector`** (default) | PostgreSQL + pgvector extension. HNSW on `vector_cosine_ops`, tuneable `m` / `ef_construction`. Same operational Postgres as the canonical store AND the BM25 projection, with DB-enforced Row-Level Security per scope. |
| **`qdrant`**  | Self-hosted or Qdrant Cloud (`uv sync --extra qdrant`). Good filtering + scaling when you want the dense index off Postgres. |
| **`chroma`**  | ChromaDB, in-process or server (`uv sync --extra chroma`). Simplest external option. |

Every backend is wrapped in a tenant/workspace-scoped layer, so reads and
writes are confined to `(tenant_id, workspace_id)` via a canonical
`t/<tenant>/w/<workspace>` namespace. Fusion always happens via Reciprocal Rank
Fusion over the two channels.

**Changing the embedder is a re-embed, never a fresh database.** Since 26.8.0
every dense row belongs to an *embedding set* that records the provider, the
model and the width that produced it, each set has its own partial HNSW, and
one column on the workspace says which set answers its searches. Moving a
workspace from one embedder to another — including to Azure OpenAI, which is a
first-class provider with real configuration and optional managed identity — is:

```bash
flycanon reindex --to azure:<deployment> --dimensions 1536                  --tenant t-123 --workspace w-456
```

The old set serves every search for the whole run, the switch is one `UPDATE`,
and `--rollback` is the same `UPDATE` backwards. One shared flycanon can serve
different tenants on different embedders at the same time. See
[deployment.md § Embedding providers](docs/deployment.md#embedding-providers)
and [operations-runbook.md § 7b](docs/operations-runbook.md).

## Answer modes (RLM default / RAG deprecated)

The non-streaming answer path (`POST /api/v1/query`, `POST
/api/v1/query/stream`, and the agent-tier equivalents) is served by one
of two engines, selected by `FLYCANON_ANSWER_MODE`:

| Mode | Engine | Status |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| **`rlm`** (default) | **Recursive Language Model** — a code-driven [CodeAct](docs/architecture.md) REPL. A root orchestrator writes Python against the in-scope document corpus (handed to it as a `docs` variable), makes recursive sub-calls on slices, and finishes by citing the filings / pages it used. It reasons over **whole documents** rather than retrieving chunks. | Default. |
| `rag` | Legacy **hybrid retrieval** answerer (BM25 + dense + RRF, then a grounded LLM answer over the top hits). | **Deprecated**, opt-in. |

RAG is opt-in and **deprecated**: when `FLYCANON_ANSWER_MODE=rag` the
dispatcher emits a server-side deprecation warning log on every
RAG-mode answer (`FLYCANON_ANSWER_MODE=rag is deprecated and will be
removed in a future release; RLM is the default`), and the answer
endpoints return a client-facing `X-Flycanon-Deprecation` response
header carrying the same message. The legacy RAG answer path is slated
for removal in a future release — `/search` (raw hybrid retrieval, no
LLM) is unaffected and stays.

**Operational requirements for RLM (the default):**

- **Originals in the object store.** RLM reasons over the original
  document bytes, so intake must persist each original
  (`FLYCANON_STORE_ORIGINALS=true`, the default) to the configured
  object store (`FLYCANON_OBJECT_STORE_BACKEND` — `localfs` for
  dev/test, `s3` for production). Sources without a stored original
  (no `object_store_key`) are skipped by the RLM corpus builder.
- **A provider credential for the RLM models.**
  `FLYCANON_RLM_ROOT_MODEL` (which also produces the final answer) and
  `FLYCANON_RLM_SUB_MODEL` (the REPL's sub-calls) both default to
  `anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6` and both accept `anthropic:<model>` or
  `azure:<deployment>`. On `anthropic:` the engine calls the Messages API
  directly and **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** must be set at runtime; on
  `azure:` it calls Azure OpenAI Chat Completions with the same
  `FLYCANON_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` / `_API_KEY` the embedding path uses.
  Both settings must name the same provider, and any other prefix is
  refused at boot with the supported list in the message.

See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md#answer-mode-rlm-default--rag-deprecated)
for every RLM / object-store env var and its default.

## Quickstart

For a standalone release-wheel installation, follow [Install the released server](docs/released-server-install.md). It includes the required framework Git references, runtime configuration and migration scaffold.

> **Want the 10-minute curl tour instead?** &nbsp;See [`QUICKSTART.md`](QUICKSTART.md)
> — `task docker:up:test` + one curl call against a mock LLM, no API keys.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fireflyframework/flycanon.git
cd flycanon
task deps:install          # uv sync --extra dev (pins .venv)
task docker:up             # api + worker + postgres(pgvector) + redis
curl -fsS http://localhost:8500/actuator/health | jq .
```

Every tenant route needs two scope headers and, when
`FLYCANON_API_KEYS` is set, the platform key. Export them once:

```bash
export CANON_HEADERS=(-H 'X-Tenant-Id: acme' -H 'X-Workspace-Id: ws-demo' \
                      -H 'X-API-Key: change-me' -H 'Content-Type: application/json')
```

Ingest a sample DOCX. The intake endpoint is **JSON only** -- the bytes
travel base64-encoded in `content_base64` (there is no multipart form;
the binary normaliser sniffs the real format from the bytes):

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:8500/api/v1/sources "${CANON_HEADERS[@]}" \
  -d "{\"filename\":\"sample.docx\",
       \"content_base64\":\"$(base64 < ./tests/fixtures/sample.docx | tr -d '\\n')\",
       \"metadata\":{\"title\":\"Sample\",\"domain\":\"process\"}}" | jq .
```

Large or bulk uploads go through the queued path -- the same body with
`?mode=async` returns an `IngestJob` you can poll or stream:

```bash
JOB=$(curl -fsS -X POST 'http://localhost:8500/api/v1/sources?mode=async' \
  "${CANON_HEADERS[@]}" -d @payload.json | jq -r .id)
curl -fsS -N "http://localhost:8500/api/v1/ingest-jobs/$JOB/stream" "${CANON_HEADERS[@]}"
```

Search the corpus:

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:8500/api/v1/search "${CANON_HEADERS[@]}" \
  -d '{"query":"what does the document say about scope","top_k":5}' | jq .
```

Ask a grounded question (`POST /api/v1/query/stream` emits the same
answer as Server-Sent Events):

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:8500/api/v1/query "${CANON_HEADERS[@]}" \
  -d '{"question":"Summarise the scope section in three sentences."}' | jq .
```

A grounded "I don't know" is `no_answer: true` (the `answer` text may
still explain what was searched) -- branch on `no_answer`, not on an
empty string. Multi-turn: `POST /api/v1/conversations` opens a session
and `POST /api/v1/conversations/{id}/turn` appends a question; turns
run on the same answer engine as `/query`.

## Local development

```bash
task dev:db              # Postgres (pgvector/pg16) + Redis only
task dev:migrate         # alembic upgrade head
task dev:serve           # FastAPI hot-reload on :8500
task dev:worker          # EDA worker in a separate terminal
```

Smoke the running service:

```bash
task health              # /actuator/health
task version             # /api/v1/version
task openapi             # /openapi.json
```

## SDKs

Both SDKs are published at `26.5.7` and target the route set of that
release. The 26.7.x server keeps every route they call except the ones
renamed since (`sources:async` -> `sources?mode=async`,
`query:stream` -> `query/stream`, `conversations/{id}/turns` ->
`conversations/{id}/turn`); the Python SDK is realigned in this
release, the Java SDK follows with its next tag. Generate fresh clients
from `openapi.json`, which since 26.7.1 declares the `X-Tenant-Id` /
`X-Workspace-Id` / `X-Agent-Token` / `Idempotency-Key` headers and the
API-key security schemes.

| SDK | Highlights |
|-----|------------|
| [**Python**](sdks/python/README.md) | Async-first, `httpx` + Pydantic. Python ≥ 3.11. |
| [**Java**](sdks/java/README.md)     | **Spring Boot 3.5.9 + Spring `RestClient` + Jackson. Java 25 (LTS). `groupId = com.firefly`.** Ships an `@AutoConfiguration` so a `CanonClient` bean is wired straight from `flycanon.*` properties. |

Java consumers just declare the dependency and inject the bean:

```java
@Service
public class CopilotService {
    private final CanonClient canon;
    public CopilotService(CanonClient canon) { this.canon = canon; }
    // canon.submitSource(...), canon.search(...), canon.answer(...)
}
```

|----------|---------------|
| [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) | You want your first ingest + search + answer in ten minutes (HTTP / curl). |
| [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) | You need the data model, the binary-normaliser routing matrix, the Postgres-native retrieval design, the dependency arrows. |
| [docs/pipeline.md](docs/pipeline.md) | You're touching the orchestrator, adding a new stage, or chasing a slow ingest. |
| [docs/api-reference.md](docs/api-reference.md) | You're integrating with the HTTP API and need every endpoint, shape, and status code. |
| [docs/payload-reference.md](docs/payload-reference.md) | You're composing the request payload — every field, option, and example. |
| [docs/eda-events.md](docs/eda-events.md) | You're subscribing to the `flycanon.ingest` / `flycanon.knowledge` / `flycanon.audit` / `canon.workspaces.v1` topics. |
| [docs/consumers.md](docs/consumers.md) | You're building or auditing a service that consumes flycanon -- agent token scopes, workspace events, retry posture, wire-contract stability. |
| [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) | You're running this in production — env vars, topologies, OCR engines, embedding providers, auth, observability, sizing. |
| [docs/cicd.md](docs/cicd.md) | You're cutting a release or wiring CI/CD — the three GitHub Actions workflows, release cookbook, required secrets. |
| [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md) | The service / ingest / search / answer surface is misbehaving — symptom → root cause → fix. |
| [docs/glossary.md](docs/glossary.md) | You need a precise definition for a term the API or docs use. |
| [sdks/python/README.md](sdks/python/README.md) | You're integrating from Python — async-first SDK with Pydantic typing. |
| [sdks/java/README.md](sdks/java/README.md) | You're integrating from Java / Spring Boot — Spring Boot 3.5.9, `com.firefly` groupId, `@AutoConfiguration`. |

The OpenAPI 3.1 document is served live by the running service at
`/openapi.json`, with Swagger UI at `/docs` and Redoc at `/redoc`.
