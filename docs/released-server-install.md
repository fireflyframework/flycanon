# Install the released server

The server wheel requires Python 3.13 and explicit framework references. Package installers do not apply the repository's `[tool.uv.sources]` settings when installing a wheel. Use the release requirements file to reproduce the qualified framework selection.

Use the released source archive for the operator configuration and migration files, and install the released wheel for the Python application. This keeps the runtime configuration and executable package on the same version.

## Download and verify

Download `flycanon-26.10.6-py3-none-any.whl`, `flycanon-26.10.6.tar.gz`, `runtime-requirements-26.10.6.txt`, and `SHA256SUMS` from the [26.10.6 release](https://github.com/fireflyframework/flycanon/releases/tag/v26.10.6). Verify the downloaded files against their matching checksum entries before extracting or installing them.

```bash
tar -xzf flycanon-26.10.6.tar.gz
cd flycanon-26.10.6
uv venv --python 3.13 .venv
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r ../runtime-requirements-26.10.6.txt
```

The requirements file selects the released server wheel and these canonical framework references:

```text
pyfly @ git+https://github.com/fireflyframework/fireflyframework-pyfly.git@v26.09.04
fireflyframework-agentic @ https://github.com/fireflyframework/fireflyframework-agentic/releases/download/v26.10.1/fireflyframework_agentic-26.10.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

The equivalent installation without a requirements file is:

```bash
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python \
  'flycanon @ https://github.com/fireflyframework/flycanon/releases/download/v26.10.6/flycanon-26.10.6-py3-none-any.whl' \
  'pyfly @ git+https://github.com/fireflyframework/fireflyframework-pyfly.git@v26.09.04' \
  'fireflyframework-agentic @ https://github.com/fireflyframework/fireflyframework-agentic/releases/download/v26.10.1/fireflyframework_agentic-26.10.1-py3-none-any.whl'
```

The runtime dependency references are unchanged from `26.10.4`. Installing optional providers may require additional extras and configuration; installation does not verify database access, cloud accounts or model-provider credentials.

## Framework migration compatibility

This release retains pyfly `v26.09.04` and the existing PostgreSQL EDA outbox. A later pyfly upgrade uses different outbox tables and requires a separate drain or replay of queued legacy events. Qualify that cutover before changing the pyfly pin; the current migration history and Azure/RLM behavior remain the existing ones.

## Configure the runtime

Keep `pyfly.yaml`, `alembic.ini`, `migrations/`, and `env_template` from the source archive in the working directory. The wheel does not supply the root-level `pyfly.yaml`. The release also provides a byte-identical `pyfly-26.10.6.yaml` copy for operators who already have a migration scaffold; install it as `pyfly.yaml` in the runtime working directory.

The configuration selects the PostgreSQL event adapter and separate API/worker consumer groups. Starting without it can activate framework defaults, including an attempted Kafka connection to `localhost:9092` and a separate management listener. Do not rely on those defaults for the released service.

Set the database URL, embedding model and dimensions, provider credentials, platform API keys, object-storage location, and optional Redis settings for your environment. Use [`env_template`](https://github.com/fireflyframework/flycanon/blob/v26.10.6/env_template) and the [deployment guide](https://github.com/fireflyframework/flycanon/blob/v26.10.6/docs/deployment.md) for the exact settings. Store real secrets outside published configuration and supply them through your operator's environment or secret manager.

Provision the PostgreSQL database, required extensions and roles using the deployment guide. Apply migrations as a separate operator step before serving a new database:

```bash
.venv/bin/flycanon migrate
```

`flycanon migrate` uses `alembic.ini` in the current working directory and applies `upgrade head` with `FLYCANON_DATABASE_URL`. Run it from the reviewed source archive's root, even when the wheel is installed elsewhere. A missing configuration file returns a nonzero exit and identifies the required scaffold before migration starts. The command does not search parent directories or the installed package for another configuration.

For retained `26.10.4` wheel installations, use Alembic directly from that release's scaffold until upgrading the CLI:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m alembic -c alembic.ini upgrade head
```

Keep the original configuration, migration files and database URL together. Updating the CLI does not migrate a database automatically.

Run from the directory containing the reviewed `pyfly.yaml`:

```bash
.venv/bin/uvicorn flycanon.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8500
```

For asynchronous intake, start the worker from the same configured directory in another process:

```bash
.venv/bin/flycanon worker
```

The standard `flycanon serve` command listens on all interfaces using `FLYCANON_PORT`. The explicit loopback command above is suitable for a local acceptance check; configure your deployment listener and gateway separately.

## Verify the installed service

```bash
.venv/bin/python -c 'from importlib.metadata import version; print(version("flycanon"), version("pyfly"), version("fireflyframework-agentic"))'
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8500/api/v1/version
```

Verify authenticated source ingestion, source retrieval and canonical-memory retrieval in the intended tenant and workspace. A version response confirms the running package, while those operations exercise the configured database, retrieval and authorization boundaries. Repository integration tests cover tenant/workspace isolation; each released artifact and newly provisioned operator environment still needs installed-server and authenticated ingestion/retrieval checks with its own configuration.
