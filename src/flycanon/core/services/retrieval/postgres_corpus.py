"""``PostgresCorpus`` -- BM25 over ``canon_chunks`` via tsvector + GIN.

Implements the corpus surface that :class:`HybridRetriever` consumes
on top of the canonical Postgres ``canon_chunks`` table -- the same
table the rest of flycanon writes via :class:`ChunkRepository`. The
BM25 projection rides on a GENERATED ``tsv`` column populated
automatically by Postgres (see migration ``0003_bm25_tsv``); flycanon
never has to maintain it.

Methods called by the retriever:

* :meth:`bm25_search`  -- returns the top-k chunks for a free-text
  query, ranked by ``ts_rank_cd``.
* :meth:`get_chunks`   -- hydrates a list of chunk ids into the
  ``StoredChunk`` shape the retriever's RRF pass expects.

Methods used by :class:`IndexService` to keep the corpus interface
stable:

* :meth:`upsert_chunks`     -- no-op (canon_chunks is the canonical
  store; the ``tsv`` projection is maintained by the GENERATED
  column).
* :meth:`delete_by_doc_id`  -- no-op (the source-id FK cascades the
  delete to ``canon_chunks``).
* :meth:`initialise` / :meth:`close` -- no-ops (Alembic owns the
  schema lifecycle).

This module never reads or writes ``canon_chunk_vectors`` -- the
dense projection lives on :class:`PgVectorVectorStore`.

Row-level security
------------------

``canon_chunks`` and ``canon_sources`` are FORCE-RLS tables (migration
``0013``): a role without ``BYPASSRLS`` sees only the rows whose
``(tenant_id, workspace_id)`` equal the ``app.tenant_id`` /
``app.workspace_id`` GUCs of the current transaction, and sees NOTHING
when they are unset. The ORM path sets them through the ``after_begin``
listener in :mod:`flycanon.web.conventions.db`; this corpus, however,
runs its reads on a bare Core connection of its own engine, where no
Session -- and so no listener -- is involved. Until 26.7.1 that meant
the BM25 channel returned zero rows under the application role, and
the fused ``/search`` answered ``hits: []`` while the vector channel
alone found the chunk (measured by the dworkers programme on
2026-09-17 against a ``flycanon_app`` role; invisible in a stack where
every process is the database owner). Every scoped read here therefore
binds the GUCs itself, from the explicit scope it is handed, inside the
same transaction as the query -- see :meth:`_scoped_connection`.
